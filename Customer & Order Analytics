#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many many unique orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ' ';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ' '
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ' ';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product
,sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum)
,avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ' ';
